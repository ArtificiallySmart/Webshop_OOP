# webshop

Webshop I'll be making for CodeGorilla Base/Bootcamp

## To Do:

### Important

- Rename variables so they make sense.
- Remove "item is already in cart" message, maybe change to "x in shopping cart" on button.
- change shopping cart button to be responsive

### Nice to have

- Add thumbnails to the images on the item pages
- Give visual confirmation on button that item is in cart (color change)
- Find way to store and output formatted text
- make login
  - isLoggedIn and isDev
  - dev has access to new item pages and info about users.
- make userpages
- Advanced search
- show categories in search
- show relevant categories in search (when search chair, suggest furniture/chairs)
- x results per page on search
- filters on search
- Admin page with CRUD compatibility
